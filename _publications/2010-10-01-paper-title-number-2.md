Deep learning technologies have been widely used in various fields, significantly improving the quality of daily life, but with them comes growing privacy concerns. Personal and sensitive information contained in large-scale datasets is prone to leakage due to mismanagement. In this paper, we systematically explore the privacy protection techniques in deep learning, and analyze the privacy risks in the process of data collection, storage, sharing, and model training and release. By introducing the principles, advantages and limitations of techniques such as differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation and federated learning, as well as practical application cases, this paper reveals the balance between privacy protection and model performance. Meanwhile, it looks forward to future research directions, including improving algorithmic efficiency and interpretability, constructing a comprehensive privacy protection framework, developing adaptive mechanisms and exploring cross-domain applications. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive perspective for researchers and industry experts to promote deep learning to play a positive role continuously with privacy protection.
